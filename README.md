# React + Vite


hey boys I made a little app to follow up your bills or expenses, from a budget you will start to decrease according to your expenses. 

umm works like a bank app where each transaction will decrease the money in your account , but here you can Edit, Update, Create, and Delete one 

To delete or Edit one you have to slide the expenses to left or rigth 

Note: is not responsive design until now, I mean to a better experience try in a computer or tablet not in your phone

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
